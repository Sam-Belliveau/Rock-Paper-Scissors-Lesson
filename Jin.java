/*
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (/ˈniːtʃə, ˈniːtʃi/;[27][28] German: [ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈniːtʃə] 
(About this soundlisten) or [ˈniːtsʃə];[29][30] 15 October 1844 – 25 August 1900) was a German 
philosopher, cultural critic, composer, poet, and philologist whose work has exerted a profound 
influence on modern intellectual history.[31][32][33][34][35] He began his career as a classical 
philologist before turning to philosophy. He became the youngest person ever to hold the Chair 
of Classical Philology at the University of Basel in 1869 at the age of 24.[36] Nietzsche resigned 
in 1879 due to health problems that plagued him most of his life; he completed much of his core writing
in the following decade.[37] In 1889, at age 44, he suffered a collapse and afterward a complete loss
of his mental faculties. He lived his remaining years in the care of his mother until her death in 1897
and then with his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche. Nietzsche died in 1900.[38]
